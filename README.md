# book_app

**Author**: Corey Marchand and Kyungrae Kim  
**Version**: 1.1.0

## Overview
This lab is to implement a basic full stack application for a book list which will include:
* Search the Google Books API
* Add books to a database
* Render those books from a PostgreSQL database
* Update the details of a book or remove it from the collection

Lab 12 involves adding the ability for a user to select a book from the API search results and add it to their collection, which will be persisted in a PostgreSQL database. Then, when a user navigates to the home page of the application, all of the books will be retrieved from the database and displayed on the screen. The API search form will be accessible through the menu.
