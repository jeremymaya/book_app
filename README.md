# book_app

**Author**: Corey Marchand and Kyungrae Kim  
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This lab is to implement a basic full stack application for a book list which will include:
* Search the Google Books API
* Add books to a database
* Render those books from a PostgreSQL database
* Update the details of a book or remove it from the collection

Lab 11 will involves requesting books from the API. The client can submit a form to search for a book by title or author, and the search results will then be rendered as a list in the browser.
